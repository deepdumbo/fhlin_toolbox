Fa-Hsuan:

Here are the masks that you asked for. I was not sure which best suited your
needs, so I have included several of them. Any file that starts with a number
(0.33, 1, 3) is the mask that pertains to that condition at that speed. For
example 0.33R was generated from all twelve subjects tapping with their
right thumb at 0.33 Hz. Files without a number represent masks that were
generated for all three conditions combined (0.33, 1, 3 Hz) with the
specified hand. I hope that this covers what you need. I'm working on
the other files that you requested and will hopefully get them to you soon.
